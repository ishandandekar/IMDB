# Ishan's Movie Database

Idea is to make a CLI/TUI application to create and maintain a watchlist

I had my watchlist in Google Keeps but it grew to the extent where it could not handle. I shifted to Google Docs (pretty stupid I know). And now my Google storage is hitting ~92%. Hence this.
Downfall is that I won't be able put movies in watchlist with my phone, but wtv. Not thinking about long-term problems

This will be made using golang, I'll incorporate sqlite3 as backend db to keep it locally and to keep it simple. I'll also make CLI using Cobra. This way I'll learn some new things.

This is a pet project. IDK if I'll ever complete this, but I'm excited.
